## Instructions ##

For further understanding of the problem in question 1, you can run the simulation program <a href="https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Jeremy.Jones/VivioJS/caches/cache.htm">here<a /> to visualize the process of how cache functions.
<br />
Alternatively, you can work it out using these two sheets.

## Cache Emulator ##
To run the program, you can compile <a href="https://github.com/adamlkl/Computer-Architecture-II/blob/master/Assignment6/code/cache.cpp">cache.cpp<a />
`gcc cache.cpp`

Then, just run the compiled code by
`./a.out `
Remember to adjust the L, M and N of the cache for full simulation. 

## Matrix Multiplication ##
Question3 is set up for the purpose of demonstrating how the organisation of code can maximize the efficiency of matrix multiplication. This is due to the reorganized elements in the transposed matrix. Same thing, run the code as following. 
`make`
Then run 
`./matrixMultiply`
